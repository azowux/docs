# Continuous Phishing simulations

## You will get

A list of **trained** employees who **were vulnerable to the phishing attack** and whos access to your money and production services could **cost you that money and reputation**.

## Scenarios

You need to develop as many scenarios, as you can.  
Even if you feel, that you would not open the link/input any data.  
You are not the target in some scenarios if you are reading this :\)

Scenarios can be based on:

* World trends \(COVID-19 for now\)
* Popular social networks in your country
* Your infrastructure stack
* Target group interests

## Templates

* Just use [email generators](https://topol.io/) and WYSIWYG editors

## Fr**equency**

Don't make it the pattern. Your colleagues should not receive phishing mails each friday or each first day of the month.  
Phishing should be unexpected.

## Metrics

* Open rate \(ok\)
* Click rate \(people should receive some learning materials with the test\)
* Submit rate \(your potential leakages\)

## Automation
