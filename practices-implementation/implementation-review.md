# Implementation review

You can build this practice **not only as an independent** one but also as a part of the SDLC

{% page-ref page="../sdlc-secure-development-lifecycle.md" %}

## What will you get

* The list of the implementation issues and fix steps

## What will change

* Developers will get more bugs from testing phase, so they will be able to solve issues before production

## What is the process

* Deploy your changes to the testing environment
* Get issues from your security testing team \(**scanner/CI stag**e report in a good way\)
* Fix these issues by priority

It can be helpful here, if your team has any questions:

{% page-ref page="security-champions.md" %}
