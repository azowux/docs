# Security champions

### **What is the point to build this practice?**

* **Cost-saving** You don't need to hire 20+ security engineers
* **Employees motivation** Employees like learning. Give this benefit to them
* **Security coverage** You will have at least 1 person in each team, who will help you to build products secure by design
* **Quality** Security champions are involved in all architecture meetings. Together they can spread best practices, which will reduce the time to production in the future.
* **Communication time reduce** Security and r&d must be closer to each other. Usually, it can take a while to get the approval to do something from security department. Security champions can help you to solve this problem.
* **BugBounty savings** You will get internal security reports from them
